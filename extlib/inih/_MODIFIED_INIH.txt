This copy of inih-r44 is a modified version of the original.

The following changes have been made to the original:

- INI files are opened in binary mode instead of text mode.

- Callback functions have explicit __cdecl annotations to ensure
  they work properly if compiling with 32-bit MSVC using /Gz.
  (default stdcall)
