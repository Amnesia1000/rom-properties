commit cb55f57d87ae840bd0f65dbe6bd22fa021a873a7
meson: add static compile args to inih_dep (#126)

Tag: r53

The following changes have been made to the original:

- INI files are opened in binary mode instead of text mode.

- Callback functions have explicit __cdecl annotations to ensure
  they work properly if compiling with 32-bit MSVC using /Gz.
  (default stdcall)

- The Meson build scripts have been removed.
