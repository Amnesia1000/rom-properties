commit fbfd4e82f7a3e0aa3b39fa97958c8d25f90db940
Version 2.8.8.

Tag: 2.8.8

The following changes have been made to the original:

- cmake_minimum_required() has been disabled. The project-wide values
  will be used instead.

- Certain compile definitions are exported as part of the libminizip
  target, since they're needed in order to prevent build errors in
  other projects.

- Some other functionality not needed by rom-properties has been disabled.
