This copy of minizip is based on the updated version maintained
by Nathan Moinvaziri at https://github.com/nmoinvaz/minizip .

commit 2ca7f3950cf2cebeacdeac41cf1593cc60802c56
Version 2.8.2.

Tag: 2.8.2

The following changes have been made to the original:

- cmake_minimum_required() has been disabled. The project-wide values
  will be used instead.

- Certain compile definitions are exported as part of the libminizip
  target, since they're needed in order to prevent build errors in
  other projects.

- Some other functionality not needed by rom-properties has been disabled.
