commit 488f20ff1bbf365704017066e9d81b35a78d7458
Version 2.8.5.

Tag: 2.8.5

The following changes have been made to the original:

- cmake_minimum_required() has been disabled. The project-wide values
  will be used instead.

- Certain compile definitions are exported as part of the libminizip
  target, since they're needed in order to prevent build errors in
  other projects.

- Some other functionality not needed by rom-properties has been disabled.
