This copy of zlib-ng 2.0.2 is a modified version of the original.

commit 5fe25907ea1da498a75e4b842b9d97ca27acf1ed
Version 2.0.2

Tag: 2.0.2

The following changes have been made to the original:

- CMakeLists.txt has been edited to prevent building the Win32 resource
  data when being built as a shared library.

- Example binaries are no longer built.

- CMakeLists.txt now sets the target compile definitions to -DZLIB_CONST
  and sets the target include directories. This allows all targets
  that depend on zlib/zlibstatic to automatically pick up the compile
  definitions and include directories.

- cmake_minimum_required() is disabled, since it interfered with
  policies set by the main build infrastructure.

- Some other functionality not needed by rom-properties has been disabled.
