This copy of zlib-ng 2.0.0-RC2 is a modified version of the original.

commit 7606b9f39a2c7701a30d06a786fb2a99334b1feb
Version 2.0.0 Release Candidate 2

Tag: v2.0.0-RC2

The following changes have been made to the original:

- CMakeLists.txt has been edited to prevent building the Win32 resource
  data when being built as a shared library.

- Example binaries are no longer built.

- CMakeLists.txt now sets the target compile definitions to -DZLIB_CONST
  and sets the target include directories. This allows all targets
  that depend on zlib/zlibstatic to automatically pick up the compile
  definitions and include directories.

- cmake_minimum_required() is disabled, since it interfered with
  policies set by the main build infrastructure.

- Some other functionality not needed by rom-properties has been disabled.
